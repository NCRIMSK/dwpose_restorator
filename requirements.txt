# Notes:
# - On Windows, installing `torch` may require selecting the proper wheel for your CUDA
#   version. See https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for recommended install commands.
# - If you only need CPU, install the CPU-only wheel (pip will choose a CPU wheel by default
#   if CUDA-enabled wheels are not available for your platform).
